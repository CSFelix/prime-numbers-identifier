    "`Prime Numbers` are especific natural numbers that cannot be divised by other natural ones, but itself and 1. Natural numbers are those ones that are positives and integers, that is, fall into the range from 1 to positive infinite. And you may be wondering: \"*Yeah, yeah, I learned about them on school. So what? What do they have that make them so special?*\". Well, let's go to the explanation!\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have ever heard from someone or read on the internet that you can do anything with your computer, especially if you know how to program. I am afraid, but I have bad news: That's *\"bullshit\"*! To a problem be considered possible to be solved by computers, it has to follow two conditions: 1) a pattern to solve the problem must exist and be possible to be implemented with a computer; and 2) the implementation should solve it in a considerable period of time using a considerable process cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Computer Science there are the **Nondeterministic Polynomial Problems (*NPs*)**, they are problems that does not follow one or both of the previous conditions, and guess what? Identifying `whether a number is prime or not` is one of them - just for curiosity, all NP problems are listed here: [List of Unsolved Problems in Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Guessing whether 5, 8, 80 and 987 are primes or not is a easy task for a computer, but when the number of digits increases, it becomes a tough task, demanding more time and process cost to solve it. For instance, consider the number 983,129,319,128,349,245,423,213,643,369,126,335,654,234,126,324,363, quite a big one, right?

    "Having this in mind, Security Engineers chosen the Prime Numbers to be the base of Cyber Security Cyphers, such as `Hash Tables` and `Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman (RSA) Algorithm`. In `RSA`, two large prime numbers are multiplied to result in a huge number to generate the `public and private keys`, that will be used to encrypt and decrypt messages respectively. If a computer be able to decompose this huge number, the machine would be able to get the prime numbers that generated it and then, calculate the `private key` and decript any message encrypted by its public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this becomes possible, the cyber-security in general would be in chaos. Imagine hackers getting access to your private messages and bank accounts. Now think bigger, picture hackers getting access to government databases and stealing and encrypting critical datas. The world would be in collapse!!\n",
